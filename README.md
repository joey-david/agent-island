# Topnotchers

A minimal notch monitor for Claude Code and Codex on macOS.

![Topnotchers demo](docs/demo.gif)

The island uses the notch's own black and shape, so it reads as part of the hardware, and with no
agent running there is nothing on screen. Each session adds a small pixel pet beside the notch. It
animates while the agent works, gets an orange dot when it asks you something and a green one when
it's done. Hover a pet to see the task and what the agent is doing right now.

Questions and permission prompts drop down under the notch, so you can answer without finding the
terminal. Clicking a pet focuses its Ghostty tab, or opens the thread in ChatGPT for Codex sessions
started there.

It's native AppKit: about 42 MB of memory at peak, no measurable CPU when nothing is happening, no
Dock icon, no account and no network access.
